All work on assignments must be done individually unless stated otherwise.
You are encouraged to discuss with your classmates about the given assignments, but these discussions should be carried out in an abstract way.
That is, discussions related to a particular solution to a specific problem (either in actual code or in the pseudocode) will not be tolerated.
In short, turning in someone else's work, in whole or in part, as your own will be considered a violation of academic integrity.
Please note that the former condition also holds for the material found on the web as everything on the web has been written by someone else.
I acknowledge that I have fully read and understood the contents of the course; I will not share my work (not even a part of it) on telegram ;
I will be responsible for what has been discussed/asked on telegram; I understand that if I have any questions or concerns about the course mechanics, it is my responsibility to discuss them with the instructors within their office hours.
